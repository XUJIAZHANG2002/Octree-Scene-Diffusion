# Octree Scene Diffusion

Official implementation of:

**Octree Scene Diffusion: Structured Latent Diffusion for Semantic 3D Scene Generation and Completion**  
Accepted at **ICRA 2026**.

---

## 🚧 Status

Code release is currently under construction.

The full training and inference pipeline will be released soon.

---

## Overview

Octree Scene Diffusion is a structured generative framework for semantic 3D scene generation and completion.  
It leverages hierarchical octree representations to enable scalable and memory-efficient diffusion modeling of large 3D environments.

More details will be added with the full code release.
